    <h1 class="mb-4">Privacy Policy for Tiny Urls</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        At <strong>Tiny Urls</strong>, we are committed to safeguarding your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our URL shortening service. By using our platform, you agree to the terms and conditions described in this policy.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        When you use Tiny Urls, we may collect certain personal information, including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not require you to provide personal information to use our URL shortening service. However, if you choose to contact us, we may collect your name, email address, and any other information you voluntarily provide in communication with us.</li>

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device to track your activities on our site. You can choose to disable cookies through your browser settings, but this may affect some functionalities of our website.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-5">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide and Improve Our Service:</strong> We use the collected data to ensure the proper functioning of our URL shortening service and to improve our website's performance, security, and usability.</li>
        <li><strong>To Monitor Usage:</strong> We analyze the data to understand how users interact with our service, which helps us to enhance user experience and troubleshoot any issues.</li>

    <p>
        Your privacy is very important to us, and we take the protection of your information seriously. We use a variety of security measures to protect your personal data, including encryption, secure servers, and firewalls. However, no data transmission over the internet is 100% secure, so while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data to third parties. However, we may share non-personal, aggregated data with trusted third parties, such as analytics providers, to help us improve our service. This data does not personally identify you.

    <p>
        Tiny Urls may also use third-party service providers to perform certain functions on our behalf, such as hosting services or email marketing. These third-party providers are only given access to the data necessary to perform their functions, and they are required to protect the confidentiality of your information.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">5. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>
        Our website may contain links to other websites. Please note that these third-party sites have their own privacy policies, which we do not control. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of these external sites before sharing any personal information.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information at any time.
